### Hello there üëã

This account is a wall between my hobby and my work for [ActiveMe](https://www.activeme.be/)

Most of the projects and code are going to be private.   
If you see a public repository on this account it means:
- it has **no direct link** to a NDA (non disclosure agreement)
- makes it public should not have impact on the clients
- we agree with ActiveMe to keep it public for education purpose

May the code be with you.  

Kind regards,  
Eloi
