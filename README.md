### Hello there üëã

This account is a wall between my hobby and my work for [ActiveMe](https://www.activeme.be/) .

The main goals of this account are:
- have a wall between my open source code account @EloiStree and my work for ActiveMe.
- provide support for developers working with my code during and after my partnership with ActiveMe.
- provide an account I can share access with ActiveMe and give back full control when I will stop working with them.

Most of the projects and code are going to be private.   
If you see a public repository on this account it means:
- it has **no direct link** to a NDA
- we agree with ActiveMe to keep it public for education purpose
- all right go to ActiveMe so you can't use it for commercial purpose without contacting them


üì´ Contact me: https://eloistree.page.link/discord

May the code be with you.  

Kind regards,  
Eloi
